# HCMMCNVs

HCMMCNVs is a browser-based software for detecting copy number variants (CNVs) using whole exome sequencing (WES) technology in combining multiple processed bam inputs with different disease or tumor types.

This repository is a fork of the `lunching/HCMM_CNVs` repository.  This repository contains code that allows HCMM-CNVs to be run as a command line tool, rather than a shiny app.  
Please cite the original authors if you use HCMM-CNVs in your work.
